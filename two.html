			<h1>Take Two</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_1">It Takes Two</h2>
			<div>(William &#8220;Mickey&#8221; Stevenson/Sylvia Moy)</div>
			<p>HER: One can have a dream, baby<br>
				HIM: Two can make that dream so real<br>
				HER: One can talk about bein' in love<br>
				HIM: Two can say how it really feels<br>
				HER: One can wish upon a star<br>
				HIM: Two can make that wish come true, yeah<br>
				HER: One can stand alone in the dark<br>
				HIM: Two can make the light shine through</p>
			<p>CHORUS (BOTH):<br>
				It takes two, baby<br>
				It takes two, baby<br>
				Me and you, just takes two<br>
				It takes two, baby<br>
				It takes two, baby<br>
				To make a dream come true, just takes two</p>
			<p>HER: One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery<br>
				HIM: Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy<br>
				HER: One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone<br>
				HIM: Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home</p>
			<p>(chorus)<br>
				(instrumental)</p>
			<p>Just takes two, just takes two</p>
			<p>HER: One can go out to a movie, lookin' for a special treat<br>
				HIM: Two can make that single movie somethin' really kinda sweet<br>
				HER: One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinkin' that it's really nice<br>
				HIM: But two walkin' hand-in-hand is like addin' just a pinch of spice</p>
			<p>(repeat chorus and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_6">What Good Am I Without You</h2>
			<div>(with Kim Weston)</div>
			<p>BOTH:<br>
				Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh</p>
			<p>HER:<br>
				What good would a rose be if the raindrops didn't fall?<br>
				What good is a telephone if there's no one to call?<br>
				What good is a wedding if no one says &#8220;I do&#8221;?<br>
				Tell me, baby what good am I without you?</p>
			<p>BOTH:<br>
				Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh</p>
			<p>HIM:<br>
				What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?<br>
				What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?<br>
				Tell me, what good is a sweetheart who proves to be untrue?<br>
				What good, baby, am I without you?</p>
			<p>HIM: I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know<br>
				HER: I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so<br>
				HIM: What good is living without the one you love?<br>
				HER: And what good is the heavens without the stars above?<br>
				HIM: What good is a true heart that proves to be broken in two?<br>
				BOTH (repeat and fade): What good, baby, am I without you?</p>

			<h2 id="fx_11">Heaven Sent You, I Know</h2>
			<div>(Backup singers: Heaven must have sent you, I know)</div>
			<p>HER:<br>
				Every night I say a prayer<br>
				Before I go to sleep<br>
				Suddenly you were there<br>
				Your face so fine, your voice so sweet<br>
				In these arms of mine<br>
				I found you just in time<br>
				In this turn of the world<br>
				I was a lost and lonely girl<br>
				But then a miracle happened;<br>
				Heaven must have sent you, I know<br>
				(Yes I know)<br>
				I know (yes I know)</p>
			<p>HIM:<br>
				Funny how my empty heart<br>
				Used to feel like a heavy load<br>
				Suddenly you were there<br>
				Like a friend on a lonesome road<br>
				Right into these arms of mine<br>
				I found you, I found you just in time<br>
				'Cause I was a lonely man<br>
				Holding out my helpless hand<br>
				Then a miracle happened;<br>
				Heaven must have sent you, I know<br>
				(Yes I know)</p>
			<p>BOTH:<br>
				Our time is here now<br>
				Now matter how the world is around<br>
				In your arms I find<br>
				Some kind of love and peace of mind<br>
				'Cause a miracle happened;<br>
				Heaven must have sent you, I know<br>
				(Yes I know)</p>
