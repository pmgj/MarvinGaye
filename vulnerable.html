			<h1>Vulnerable</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_1">Why Did I Choose You</h2>
			<div>(Michael Leonard/Herbert Martin)</div>
			<p>Why did I choose you ? What did I see in you ?<br>
				I saw the heart you hide so well :<br>
				I saw a quiet man, who had a gentle way,<br>
				a way that caught me in its glowing spell.</p>
			<p>Why did I want you ? What could you offer me ?<br>
				A love to last a life-time through ?<br>
				And when I lost my heart so many years ago,<br>
				I lost it lovingly and willingly to you.</p>
			<p>If I had to choose again, I would still choose you.</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Funny, Not Much</h2>
			<div>(Larry Holofcener/Edward Scott)</div>
			<p>Funny, how I've stopped loving you<br>
				I can pass you on the street and my heart don't skip a beat<br>
				Not much, so much my eyes wanna cry<br>
				Funny, how I've stopped loving you<br>
				I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame<br>
				Not much, so much my heart wants to die</p>
			<p>Now that you're standing here, darling, I don't shed a tear<br>
				This is just the rain in my eyes<br>
				And if I have proved to you everything I say is true<br>
				Please help me believe my own lies</p>
			<p>Funny, how I've stopped loving you<br>
				And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss<br>
				Your touch, no I don't love you, not much</p>
			<p>Funny, how I've stopped loving you<br>
				And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss<br>
				Your touch, no I don't love you, not much</p>
			<p>No I don't love you, not much</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">This Will Make You Laugh</h2>
			<div>(Irene Higginbotham)</div>
			<p>This will make you laugh<br>
				I placed my dreams on you<br>
				This will make you laugh<br>
				They never did come true</p>
			<p>I took a chance on the one romance<br>
				And vowed it couldn't miss<br>
				But I should have known to never judge<br>
				A heart by a kiss</p>
			<p>This will make you laugh<br>
				I once believed in you<br>
				And for all my love<br>
				You didn't see it though</p>
			<p>Of all the fools I break the rules<br>
				Oh but I love you still you see<br>
				This will make you laugh<br>
				But honey it's not funny to me</p>

			<h2 id="fx_5">The Shadow Of Your Smile</h2>
			<div>(Johnny Mandel/Paul Francis Webster)</div>
			<p>The shadow of your smile<br>
				When you are gone<br>
				Will color all my dreams<br>
				And light the dawn<br>
				Look into my eyes, my love, and see<br>
				All the lovely things you are to me<br>
				A wistful little star was far too high<br>
				A tear drop kissed your lips and so did I<br>
				Now that I remember spring<br>
				All the joy that love can bring<br>
				I will be remembering<br>
				The shadow of your smile<br>
				Now when I remember spring<br>
				All the love that joy can bring<br>
				I will be remembering<br>
				The shadow of your smile...</p>

			<h2 id="fx_6">I Wish I Didn't Love You So</h2>
			<div>(Frank Loesser)</div>
			<p>I wish I didn't love you so<br>
				My love for you<br>
				Should have ended long ago</p>
			<p>I wish I didn't need your kiss<br>
				Why must your kiss<br>
				Torture me as long as this</p>
			<p>*I might be smiling by now<br>
				With some new tender friend<br>
				Smiling by now<br>
				With my heart on the mend<br>
				But when I try<br>
				Something in my heart says no<br>
				You're still there<br>
				I wish I didn't love you so</p>
			<p>(repeat *)</p>
			<p>I wish I didn't love you so</p>

			<h2 id="fx_7">I Won't Cry Anymore</h2>
			<div>(Al Frisch/Fred Wise)</div>
			<p>I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me<br>
				I won't cry anymore, now that you're gone<br>
				I've shed a million tears since we're apart<br>
				But tears can never mend a broken heart</p>
			<p>I won't cry no more, I'll just forget you<br>
				And I'm closing the door on all my memories<br>
				Though you're the one love that my arms are longin' for<br>
				This is goodbye, I won't cry anymore</p>
