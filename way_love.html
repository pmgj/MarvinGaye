			<h1>That's the Way Love Is</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_4">I Wish It Would Rain</h2>
			<p>Hmmm<br>
				Sunshine, blue skies, please go away.<br>
				My girl has found another and gone away.<br>
				With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom.<br>
				So day after day, I stayed locked up in my room.<br>
				I know to you it might sound strange.<br>
				But I wish it would rain. (How I wish that it would rain)<br>
				Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
			<p>'Cause so badly I wanna go outside. (Such a lovely day)<br>
				But everyone knows that a man ain't suppose to cry, listen.<br>
				I gotta cry 'cause cryin' eases the pain, oh yeah.<br>
				People this hurt I feel inside, words can never explain.<br>
				I just wish it would rain. (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)</p>
			<p>Oh, let it rain.<br>
				Rain, rain, rain (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)<br>
				Ooo, baby. Let it rain.<br>
				(Let it rain) Oh yeah, let it rain.</p>
			<p>[Instrumental]</p>
			<p>Day in, day out, my tear stained face<br>
				Pressed against the window pane.<br>
				My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain.<br>
				'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops.<br>
				And no one will ever know.<br>
				That I'm cryin'... cryin' when I go outside.<br>
				To the world outside my tears, I refuse to explain.<br>
				Oh, I wish it would rain. (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)<br>
				Ooo, baby.</p>
			<p>Let it rain, let it rain.<br>
				I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.<br>
				Oh, let it rain.<br>
				Oh, yeah, yeah listen.<br>
				I'm a man and I got my pride.<br>
				Give me rain or I'm gonna stay inside.<br>
				Let it rain.</p>
			<p>(Let it rain)<br>
				(Let it (rain) (rain) (rain) rain, rain)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_6">How Can I Forget</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)</div>
			<p>They ask me to forget about you<br>
				Go out and find someone new<br>
				But that won't be eas', you see<br>
				After all the things you've done for me<br>
				Told the men I ain't too proud to say<br>
				With you I stand tall and strong<br>
				'Cause without you, girl, I'm nothin' at all</p>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				How, how can I forget ya?<br>
				After all you've done for me<br>
				Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me<br>
				I, I can't forget you<br>
				It's impossible, you see<br>
				Woman, you'll always be a part of me</p>
			<p>Girl, I'm down on my bended knees<br>
				And I'm beggin' you please, beggin' you please<br>
				Woman, woman, don't set me free<br>
				'Cause right this moment in the sun<br>
				My life was wastin' away<br>
				Girl, your love gave me hope and strength<br>
				You're the reason I'm alive today<br>
				Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me<br>
				It's more precious than the evergreens</p>
			<p>(repeat chorus and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_7">Abraham, Martin And John</h2>
			<div>(Richard Holler)</div>
			<p>Anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?<br>
				Can you tell me where he's gone?<br>
				He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young<br>
				You know I just looked around and he's gone</p>
			<p>Anybody here seen my old friend John?<br>
				Can you tell me where he's gone?<br>
				He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young<br>
				I just looked around and he's gone</p>
			<p>Anybody here seen my old friend Martin?<br>
				Can you tell me where he's gone?<br>
				He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young<br>
				I just looked around and he's gone</p>
			<p>Didn't you love the things that they stood for?<br>
				Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?<br>
				And we'll be free<br>
				Some day soon, it's gonna be one day</p>
			<p>Anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?<br>
				Can you tell me where he's gone?<br>
				I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill<br>
				With Abraham, Martin, and John</p>

			<h2 id="fx_10">Cloud Nine</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)</div>
			<p>The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty<br>
				You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city<br>
				It was a one-room shack we slept in, the children beside me<br>
				We hardly had enough food or rooms<br>
				It was a hard time<br>
				Needed somethin' to ease my troubled mind.</p>
			<p>Ooooh listen<br>
				Father didn't know the meaning of work<br>
				He disrespected Mama and treated her slightly<br>
				I left home seekin' a job that I never did find<br>
				The first thing, downhearted, I took to Cloud 9</p>
			<p>I'm doin' fine up here on Cloud 9<br>
				Listen, one more time<br>
				I'm doin' fine up here on Cloud 9</p>
			<p>Folks now tell me<br>
				They say, &#8220;Give yourself a chance<br>
				And don't let life pass you by.&#8221;<br>
				But the world around you is a rat race<br>
				Where only the strong survive<br>
				It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie<br>
				It ain't even safe no more<br>
				To walk the streets at night</p>
			<p>I'm doin' fine on Cloud 9<br>
				Let me tell you about Cloud 9<br>
				(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be<br>
				(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility<br>
				(Cloud 9) Yeah, every man, every man is free<br>
				(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality<br>
				(Reality) I wanna say (up) higher (up up and away)<br>
				Cloud 9</p>
			<p>I wanna say I love the life I live<br>
				And I'm gonna live the life I love<br>
				Up here on Cloud 9<br>
				Uh uh uh uh, I'm ridin' high on Cloud 9</p>
			<p>You're as free as a bird in flight<br>
				(Cloud 9) There's no diff'rence 'tween day and night<br>
				(Cloud 9) It's a world of love and harmony<br>
				(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality<br>
				(Reality) I wanna say (up) higher (up up and away)</p>
			<p>(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be<br>
				(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility<br>
				(Cloud 9) Every man in his mind is free<br>
				(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality<br>
				(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be...</p>
