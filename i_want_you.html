			<h1>I Want You</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_1">I Want You</h2>
			<div>(Leon Ware/T-Boy Ross)</div>
			<p>I want you<br>
				The right way<br>
				I want you<br>
				But I want you to want me too</p>
			<p>I want you to want me baby<br>
				Just like I want you</p>
			<p>Oh, I'll give you all the love I need in return,<br>
				sweet darling<br>
				But half a love is all I need</p>
			<p>It's too bad<br>
				It's just too sad<br>
				You don't want me know<br>
				But I'm gonna change your mind-someway,<br>
				somehow</p>
			<p>I want you<br>
				The right way<br>
				I want you<br>
				But I want you to want me too</p>
			<p>I want you to want me baby<br>
				Just like I want you</p>
			<p>I wonder if love is just a fantasy<br>
				To share its freshness pure and fair</p>
			<p>Don't play with something you should cherish for life</p>
			<p>Don't you want to care<br>
				Ain't it lonely out there-</p>

			<h2 id="fx_2">Come Live With Me Angel</h2>
			<div>(Leon Ware/Jacqueline Hilliard)</div>
			<p>Come live with me Angel<br>
				Come live with me in comfort<br>
				Come live with me Angel<br>
				Come live with me in comfort</p>
			<p>I will understand your moods, baby<br>
				Really-ahh, really<br>
				When you want some solitude, Sugar<br>
				You can have it too<br>
				Darling, please walk around nude three times a day<br>
				So I can get you baby<br>
				I want to intrude<br>
				At least three times a day<br>
				In all the ways, baby<br>
				You can have your way<br>
				If you decide to stay</p>
			<p>This is where all your fantasies end<br>
				Let me explore all your treasures<br>
				I'll turn you on to all those freakish pleasures<br>
				Good experienced company<br>
				Who knows all the ways is what you need, baby<br>
				Just you and me-locked up for days<br>
				After we eat breakfast in bed<br>
				Turn on the music for our head</p>
			<p>Come live with me<br>
				Top of the suite, Angel<br>
				Come live with me in comfort</p>

			<h2 id="fx_8">Since I Had You</h2>
			<div>(Leon Ware/Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>This is a story<br>
				About two lovers that should have never been<br>
				They did their thing and went their separate ways again<br>
				But then by chance they met at the neighborhood dance<br>
				And got that old feelin' all over again and said...</p>
			<p>How much have you missed me<br>
				Since I had you?<br>
				How much-how much<br>
				I really wonder, girl-wonder if you remember, babe<br>
				How good you made it to me<br>
				(With your eyes you thrill me)
				Such a thrill<br>
				But it's been so long since I had you, baby</p>
			<p>Oh, Sugar-come on give me a break<br>
				'Cause it's been so long since I had you</p>
			<p>My eyes must look serious<br>
				'Cause when I look at you<br>
				I get delirious<br>
				Your voice sounds so serious<br>
				But since we're still friends<br>
				Let me make love to you again, baby</p>
			<p>Don't make me wait<br>
				Been so hard since I had you Sugar, mama<br>
				Don't make me wait<br>
				Been so hard since I had you, baby</p>
			<p>Big Daddy Rucker is sho 'nuff gettin' down<br>
				This is a mellow dance<br>
				Haven't seen you in such a long time<br>
				Remember how I used to dothis to you</p>
			<p>Since I had you, girl<br>
				I haven't wanted no other woman<br>
				Since I had you, honey<br>
				There hasn't been no other woman<br>
				Honest, babe<br>
				Since I had you, baby<br>
				There hasn't been no other woman<br>
				Since I tasted tour life<br>
				I haven't seen no other woman</p>
			<p>I love you<br>
				Since I had you<br>
				There hasn't been no other woman</p>

			<h2 id="fx_9">Soon I'll Be Loving You Again</h2>
			<div>(Leon Ware/Marvin Gaye/T-Boy Ross)</div>
			<p>Dreamed of you this morning<br>
				Then came the dawning<br>
				I thought you were here with me</p>
			<p>If you could only see<br>
				How much I love you<br>
				You'd want to trust me<br>
				In my dream I was lovin' you<br>
				Everyplace that you wanted me to<br>
				Since I believe in dreams and fantasies and things<br>
				I'd like to make love to you<br>
				Right there, baby<br>
				I've got this real strong need to-<br>
				Love you everywhere<br>
				I won't stop until I find<br>
				Your passion flowin' like wine<br>
				Baby, please let me do it to you</p>
			<p>I never did that before<br>
				But there's always a first<br>
				Time you know-so I<br>
				Made up my mind<br>
				Soon I'll be lovin' you-that's all<br>
				I've made up my mind<br>
				Soon I'll be lovin' you, girl<br>
				I know what I'm gonna do</p>
			<p>I know how to touch you<br>
				To give you that feelin'<br>
				Heat you up, my dear<br>
				So that your mood will be revealin', baby<br>
				And soon Iknow I got you willin', baby<br>
				I'm gonna give you some head, baby<br>
				I'm gonna knock you right up, woman<br>
				I'm gonna take-take you through some paces</p>

			<h2 id="fx_11">After the Dance(Vocal)</h2>
			<div>(Leon Ware/Marvin Gaye/T-Boy Ross)</div>
			<p>Dance with me<br>
				Come on dance with me, baby<br>
				Dance with me<br>
				Come on dance with me, baby</p>
			<p>I want you-and you want me<br>
				So why don't we-<br>
				Get together after the dance<br>
				Oh wow-what a freak!</p>
			<p>When I first saw you smile<br>
				You were look-lookin' good on the Soul<br>
				Train<br>
				So good-<br>
				I came back next week and I saw you there<br>
				You were dancin' good-spinnin' everywhere</p>
			<p>I thought to myself<br>
				She is so fine<br>
				The way she moves<br>
				She's so divine<br>
				She was movin' so freakishly<br>
				What she needs is me</p>
			<p>I want you-and you want me<br>
				So why don't we-<br>
				Get together after the dance</p>
			<p>And while we danced<br>
				You were so in time<br>
				The way you moved me<br>
				Your big brown eyes<br>
				(and the touch of your things)<br>
				Told me of warm things<br>
				I felt vibrations that you wanted me<br>
				We started walkin' and we started talkin'<br>
				You needed my sweet lovin', baby</p>
			<p>And nobody else's body's but my love, baby<br>
				'Cause that's how I feel about you<br>
				I want you to take me with you<br>
				What'cha gonna do</p>
			<p>I want you-and you want me<br>
				So why don't we-<br>
				Get together after the dance</p>
