			<p>how much do i love you?<br>
				i'll tell you no lie<br>
				how deep is the ocean?<br>
				how high is the sky?</p>
			<p>how many times a day do i think of you?<br>
				how many roses are sprinkled with dew?<br>
				how far would i travel to be where you are<br>
				how far is the journey from here to a star?</p>
			<p>and if i left you, how much would i cry?<br>
				how deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?</p>
