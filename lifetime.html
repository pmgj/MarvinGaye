			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>World, I'm not the same.<br>
				I can't remember my name half the time.<br>
				I took a walk - I thought I'd get some air -<br>
				but was really not aware of what I said or what I did.<br>
				I never see the dark of night or the light of day.<br>
				I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play.<br>
				Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me.<br>
				I'm flirting with the mother of insanity.<br>
				Oh, babe, where is my mind?<br>
				Since you left me it's been hard to find.<br>
				Oh where, where is my mind?<br>
				It started to rain, and I felt insane,<br>
				but one thing's for sure:<br>
				It's going to rain forever more<br>
				until you come back to me.<br>
				Please, babe...</p>
			<p>World, I'm not the same.<br>
				I go somewhere and can't remember how I came.<br>
				I'm completely turned around, lost in space.<br>
				It's your face I see constantly.<br>
				I never know from right or wrong, or anything.<br>
				I'm like a desperate man,<br>
				just see me try to cling<br>
				to the only other parts you've left to me. (???)<br>
				I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty.<br>
				Oh, bring back my mind.<br>
				Since you left me, honey,<br>
				I can't find it.<br>
				Oooh, honey, bring back my mind.<br>
				I'm starting to say ???<br>
				more and more every day.<br>
				Please release my soul.<br>
				Give me back control of my mind.<br>
				Only you can save me.</p>
