			<h1>Biography</h1>

			<h2>Chris Dykhouse</h2>
			<p>The music we all remember... the man we all forgot... Marvin Gaye</p>
			<p>Music permeates every aspect of our lives. From television to movies, from the car radio to the
				supermarket checkout, music has even found its way into greeting cards and children's books. Because we
				are constantly bombarded by new musicians, songs, and styles, we quickly judge and form opinions of
				these things. However, even if someone excels at entertaining and making music, we don't always remember
				them. Marvin Gaye recorded over forty albums and had forty songs reach the Top Forty with eighteen of
				those in the Top Ten; but to date, most people ask &#8220;Who?&#8221; after any mention of his name.
				Many people recognize his songs, as they frequently appear on television commercials and in other
				artists' songs, but they don't know anything about him or his life. Marvin Gaye led a troubled but
				successful life, and has even been cited by Motown as their &#8220;most successful artist&#8221; (Marvin
				Gaye Biographical Information). For this he deserves the recognition earned by his many years of
				entertaining people around the world.</p>
			<p><img src="fotos/foto53.jpg" alt="" class="tipo1">Born on April 2, 1939, Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. was born
				into a world that would influence his life greatly, in both positive and negative ways. He was the first
				son born to Alberta Gay and Marvin P. Gay Sr. of Washington D.C. Because his father was a minister in
				the Pentecostal church, Marvin was involved in music of the church from a very young age. One author
				states that &#8220;Marvin entered the church at three years old when his father encouraged him to sing,
				and even at this tender age the Reverend recognised [sic] a talent which he felt would lead to a singing
				career&#8221; (Davis 14). Marvin continued to perform for several years in his father's church, further
				developing his talents for singing and playing various instruments. However, his father served not only
				as a positive influence but also as a debilitating presence his entire life. Marvin's poor relationship
				with his father stemmed from his father's short temper and high expectations (a product of his strict
				religious faith); it &#8220;'Seemed like Mr. Gay had a grudge against his son. He had expectations which
				were too high for a little boy to reach'&#8221; (<em>Divided Soul</em> 11). In addition, Marvin seemed
				to instigate trouble with his father, going as far as adding an &#8220;e&#8221; to his last name when he
				went into show business. Even after he had established a successful career, his father's unsatisfied
				demands and abuse sontinued to plague him.</p>
			<p>Another influence that shaped Marvin from his early childhood was the neighborhood in which he spent much
				of his childhood. One interviewer said that &#8220;the most frightening time was the first 17 years, the
				ones spent in Washington D.C., in a ghetto he and his friends called Simple City&#8221; (Cahill 41). It
				was there,. in Washington D.C., that Marvin really began his singing career. Besides his involvement in
				the music of his father's church, he spent much time singing with his friends in high school, both in
				school and on street corners. After high school his father forced him into a short service in the Air
				Force; after he was discharged, Marvin formed a singing group called The Rainbows, which was aided by Bo
				Diddley and later became the Moonglows. Marvin continued to sing semi-professionally with the help of
				Harry Fuqua until Berry Gordy Jr., the founder of the fledgling Motown Record Company, discovered him in
				a nightclub. Marvin was hired as a singer in 1961, and this marked the beginning of a long, productive
				career with Motown.</p>
			<p><img src="fotos/foto57.jpg" alt="" class="tipo2">It was during his career at Motown that Marvin
				produced most of his well-known songs and his attitude was the most positive. He once said that
				&#8220;'You sweated and ached and played; but you were young, and your eyes were full of love and show
				business and music, and you were having fun and getting money for it'&#8221; (Fong-Torres 59). Although
				he was hired as a singer, Marvin initially showcased his musical talent by playing instruments for other
				artists, such as The Marvelettes and The Miracles. Eventually he started recording his own songs, but it
				wasn't until 1963 when Pride &amp; Joy hit the pop charts. This was a mixed blessing, though, as author
				David Ritz says in his book Divided Soul. The success of Pride &amp; Joy established him &#8220;as
				something more than a rhythm-and-blues star. Now white kids were listening to his music. His commercial
				value had risen dramatically. For most artists this would be a moment of great jubilation. Unable to
				enjoy his success, Marvin grew anxious&#8221; (82). This anxiety, which stemmed in part from a desire to
				please his father, accompanied him on every tour and in every concert that he performed until his death.
			</p>
			<p>In 1964, Marvin began relationships with many women that would greatly change both his life and his
				career. The first was the woman that Marvin fell in love with and married: Anna Gordy, the sister of
				Motown's founder. Marvin had already achieved 6 Top-Forty hits by this time, and his performance did not
				decrease. She was 17 years older than he was, so she provided a guiding force in Marvin's life, and he
				often said &#8220;'I sang all these songs for Anna'&#8221; (<em>Divided Soul</em> 90). It was also in
				1964 that he began singing duets with several already-famous women. The first of these women was Kim
				Weston, with whom Marvin recorded the album Together. His working relationship with Weston rapidly
				declined though, and after a short time they stopped singing together. He also sang with Diana Ross and
				Mary Wells, but it was in 1967 that he began singing duets with another of Motown's female singers:
				Tammi Terrell. This pairing of musical talents produced three albums and nine chart topping hits in just
				over two years. However, it also produced marital and emotional problems for Marvin. Marvin and Tammi
				enjoyed such great success and were so popular that many people speculated about their romantic
				involvement. In addition,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>&#8220;Women of all shades started falling for Marvin in greater numbers not only because of his
					clean-cut pretty-boy looks, but also because of the peculiarly personal nature of the love songs he
					sang with lady singers. With this visibility, however, came problems. 'I suppose you could say that
					the duets were not great for my marriage,' Marvin said&#8221; (<em>Divided Soul</em> 91-92).</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><img src="fotos/foto60.jpg" alt="" class="tipo1">His wife was a jealous woman, so his increased
				popularity and the rumors of Marvin and Tammi's romance angered her greatly. These things, on top on an
				already strained marriage, created many problems for Marvin. The next few years took a turn of events
				that also troubled him. In 1970, Terrell died of a brain tumor. Marvin had been so enamored by his
				singing partner that her death made him reclusive. With this, relationships with both of the important
				women in his life were dead or quickly dying, and he didn't know to whom he could turn. He spent several
				years hiding from the fans that had given him enormous success. He refused to perform any concerts, but
				did not cease all musical activity. &#8220;In fact, while he wanted to give the world the impression
				that he had retreated, he was, in fact, stepping out: For the first time in his career, he decided to
				produce&#8221; (Divided Soul 137).</p>
			<p>It was when he started to produce that he released an album that redefined his style and sent his career
				in a new direction. &#8220;What's Going On&#8221; was a completely different album for Marvin; there
				were changes in the production, the album sleeve, the cover, the vocal quality, and the lyrical content
				(Davis 117-118). This album was a &#8220;socioreligious work of astounding originality, a suite
				concerned not with the romance but with the soul and salvation&#8221; (<em>Divided Soul</em> 136). The
				first single released was the title track What's Going On, and this sold 70,000 copies in one week
				(Davis 119). The success of this album reinforced Marvin's sense of confidence.
				&#8220;Thirty-one-year-old Marvin Gaye was nonplussed over the single's astonishing success. It had only
				proved what he'd been trying to say for years that, given the chance, he was capable of writing and
				producing without Motown&#8221; (Davis 119). The success of this album again strained his marriage with
				Anna, so the arrival of another woman in his life was a welcome change.</p>
			<p>It was in 1973, during the production of &#8220;Let's Get It On,&#8221; that Marvin met Janis Hunter, who
				would become his second wife. She was sixteen years younger than he was, but he was so enchanted by this
				woman that exemplified his fantasies that he spent the next four years living with her. She exerted a
				great influence on his life and music, the most significant of which was seen in Let's Get It On. He
				poured his whole soul into the album, which topped the charts and further changed Marvin's career and
				image. This album was a &#8220;exuberant, unabashed paean to sex &#8220;Let's Get It On&#8221; was the
				second most popular record he made for Motown&#8221; (Fong-Torres 59). Like What's Going On, which had
				addressed social issues, the new album &#8220;revealed his struggle to get past the
				sex-only-for-procreation concept of his father's church&#8221; (<em>Divided Soul</em> 178). After the
				release of this album, Marvin felt a great change in his personal life (especially with Janis) and in
				his career.</p>
			<p><img src="fotos/foto15.jpg" alt="" class="tipo2">In 1975, Anna Gordy Gaye filed for divorce. The
				divorce proceedings were long and bitter, as Marvin became defensive and defiant and sought to
				antagonize Anna in any way he could. They finally reached a settlement, which was a little unusual:
				Marvin had to record an album and give all the proceeds to Anna in lieu of alimony. The album was Here,
				My Dear, which &#8220;contained cynical, personal statements [and] was devoted to discovering and
				sharing love, the loss of that love and the bitterness and pain caused by that loss. In other words, it
				was a breakdown of his fourteen-year-old marriage and of the joy of discovering a new love&#8221; (Davis
				175). This was the first in a series of events that deeply disturbed Marvin and drove him further into a
				self-destructive regimen of drugs and alcohol (to which he was no stranger). After having lived with her
				for four years and having had two children with her, and in another attempt at happiness, Marvin married
				Janis Hunter in 1977. This did not bring him happiness, though, since he felt trapped by his new wife
				soon after they were married, and their relationship reflected it. Marvin was also plagued by several
				substandard albums, which dealt a harsh blow to his confidence. He was using heavy amounts of cocaine
				and other drugs and spending money faster than he could make it. These pressures surrounded Marvin and
				made him feel trapped, leaving him no choice but to run away and get away from his troubles.</p>
			<p>In 1979, Marvin entered in a period of decline marked by rampant drug use, unreliability in his concert
				appearances, and a general state of ill health. It started when he fled to Hawaii and settled there for
				a few months. At one point, he suffered a drug-induced illness that made it necessary to cancel or
				postpone his concerts and tours. While he was in Hawaii, Janis visited him several times. Each time they
				argued horribly, and at one point Marvin almost killed Janis. After her second visit, Janis took their
				son and went to live with Teddy Pendergrass, one of Marvin's best friends and Janis' new lover. Finally,
				after evading the IRS and Motown for extended periods of time, Marvin retreated to England and Europe to
				tour and to try to salvage his career and reputation. His concert appearances were not well accepted,
				and his relationship with his promoter, Jeffrey Kruger, was very strained. Finally, he retreated to
				Ostend, Belgium, where he settled for a while; he was &#8220;besieged by the IRS for $2 million in back
				taxes, forced to declare bankruptcy and squabbling with Motown&#8221; (Goldberg 13). He lived there for
				a few months, relaxing and exercising to regain the figure that had gained him popularity twenty years
				earlier. While he was overseas, Motown released &#8220;In Our Lifetime&#8221;, an album that Marvin had
				nearly finished before leaving Hawaii. This outraged Marvin, as he did not feel it was complete and had
				not authorized its release. He sought to severe his ties with Motown, which he announced &#8220;as his
				signature dried on a recording contract with CBS&#8221; (Davis 228) in 1981. Senior vice-president
				Arnold Larkin had come to Belgium to negotiate the contract with Marvin, and CBS paid Motown $2 million
				to buy out the contract in 1982. Marvin then returned to recording in an attempt to patch together his
				life and his career.</p>
			<p>In 1982, Marvin released &#8220;Midnight Love&#8221; under the CBS label. He toured the United States to
				promote his new album, which eventually sold 1.5 million copies and earned him two Grammies (Marvin Gaye
				Biographical Information). It was the first top ten album he had recorded in six years, but the tour was
				a disaster, financially and artistically. &#8220;Bad business decisions and high overhead made the tour
				a financial bust, and some critics saw it as an artistic debacle as well. Gaye seemed unwilling or
				unable to cut loose with the vocal firepower that had won him legions of fans&#8221; (Goldberg 16).
				During this tour he became increasingly paranoid and he began to collect large numbers of guns.
				Defeated, rejected, and scared, Marvin needed to be with his mother.</p>
			<p><img src="fotos/foto16.jpg" alt="" class="tipo1">In 1982, in a move that would ultimately kill him,
				Marvin Gaye moved home to be with his mother. &#8220;She had survived a serious operation, but Marvin,
				in another of his fatally ironic twists, couldn't survive his final success&#8221; (Ritz 23). Just one
				month earlier, Marvin Gay Sr. had left and returned to Washington D.C. for a few months to fix up his
				home and sell it. His father's absence served as a mixed blessing for Marvin. Upon returning to L.A., he
				was able to move into a stable home, free of his father. His career seemed to be recovering, and it
				seemed like he was patching his life back together. However, it was when his father returned in January
				1983 that Marvin's death became imminent. The conflict was greater than ever, and &#8220;Marvin's
				instincts were to throw his father out of the house. Father's instincts were to prevent Marvin from
				entering the house. Nothing had changed-the fierce competition, the jealousy, the head games, the
				hatred, four long decades of smoldering resentment&#8221; (Divided Soul 313). In an environment that was
				so charged with emotion and strife, it was inevitable that Marvin and his father clash in a final stand
				off. This confrontation was on April 1, 1984.</p>
			<p>On the day before his forty-fifth birthday, Marvin Gaye was killed by his father. Marvin was in an
				upstairs bedroom, talking with his mother, when his father began yelling at them from downstairs.
				Eventually Marvin yelled back at his father, who came upstairs and confronted them. Marvin ended up
				pushing his father into the hallway, where the argument continued. Finally, Marvin Sr. went back
				downstairs. He soon returned with a .38-caliber revolver and shot Marvin twice. He threw the gun into
				the bushes and sat peacefully on the front porch, waiting for the police and the ambulance to arrive.
				Mrs. Gay ran next door to Marvin's brother Frankie's house, and the police and paramedics were called.
				&#8220;When the police and paramedics arrived the scene was inevitably one of confusion and chaos
				However, more alarming and distressing are the absurd, tragic circumstances which followed because
				Marvin Gaye need not have died!&#8221; (Davis 253). There was some confusion as to the location of the
				gun used in the murder, so the paramedics would not enter the house for over an hour. Marvin Gaye bled
				to death in his brother's arms while the paramedics stood outside. At his funeral, over 10,000 fans and
				admirers filed past his coffin to pay homage to the man that had entertained them for nearly 30 years.
				One man that was not at the funeral was Marvin Gay Sr.</p>
			<p>Marvin Gay Sr. was in the Los Angeles County Men's prison during the funeral. He claimed that his son had
				attacked him and that he fired the gun in self-defense, and even said that he didn't realize the gun was
				loaded with real bullets. He pleaded not guilty, and later that month a tumor was found in his head.
				After it was removed and he was ruled competent to stand trial, he pleaded no contest to a charge of
				voluntary manslaughter. On November 2, 1984, Marvin Gay Sr. was sentenced to five years probation for
				the murder of his son. He died in 1998 in a rest home in California.</p>
			<p>The death of Marvin Gaye caused a great immediate impact and he has gained much recognition since then.
				&#8220;Marvin Gaye's death had the same impact on the music industry and record buyers as Marilyn
				Monroe's equally tragic demise the public rushed to buy his music&#8221; (Davis 257). In 1987, Marvin
				was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1991, due to an effort headed by Los Angeles
				reporter Ron Brewington, Marvin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, this is not
				enough recognition for the man whose music spanned three decades and who survived several massive
				changes in musical styling. A man of Marvin Gaye's talent and versatility deserves to be spoken of in
				the same breaths as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson. But even without this
				recognition, Marvin Gaye still produced good music. That fact will never change.</p>
