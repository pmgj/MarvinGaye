			<h1>In The Groove</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_1">You</h2>
			<div>(Jack Goga/Ivy Jo Hunter/Jeffrey Bowen)</div>
			<p>You, you I see in my mirror in the mornin'<br>
				Instead of seein' me<br>
				I see you, I see your face<br>
				And inside me is a growing need for your embrace<br>
				In the light of day, though our faces meet<br>
				Someone there might see someone else speak<br>
				Till the dark of night, while the moon is new<br>
				While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous<br>
				Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so<br>
				Yes I need you, I need you baby</p>
			<p>Oh you, my sweetest joy<br>
				You can afford the best of life<br>
				I'm just a heartbreakin' boy<br>
				Oh you've given your love to me<br>
				Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me<br>
				We're worlds apart, so close yet very far<br>
				So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts<br>
				We meet in shadows, your friends must never know<br>
				That we are lovers, darlin'<br>
				Alhough it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see<br>
				The press of love you're givin' me<br>
				But you know, I need you baby</p>
			<p>One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine<br>
				I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine<br>
				Till then we must go on the way we have before<br>
				And never let it show without each other's souls<br>
				I'll never one-way track 'cause there's no turnin' back<br>
				Oh I need you baby</p>
			<p>(repeat verse 1 and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Chained</h2>
			<div>(Frank Wilson)</div>
			<p>Seems just yesterday you were in my arms<br>
				And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms<br>
				And now you're gone<br>
				Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone<br>
				And there's no love left to take<br>
				Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared<br>
				I did all I know<br>
				To win your love and make it so<br>
				You'd always stay but you turned away<br>
				Honey, what could I say?<br>
				How could you, how could you,<br>
				How could you do me this way?<br>
				'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection<br>
				'Cause I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction<br>
				Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah</p>
			<p>I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong<br>
				Somewhere down the line<br>
				The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah<br>
				But it won't be long<br>
				I'm gonna make it right, baby<br>
				And carry you tenderly back home<br>
				'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection<br>
				'Cause I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble<br>
				I tremble, oh you know, oh you know</p>
			<p>Oh baby, oh baby<br>
				Well, now I admit that I<br>
				Haven't been the perfect guy<br>
				For a girl as sweet as you<br>
				But my heart and soul cries, How do you?<br>
				Oh, that's all I need<br>
				Oh, gonna make it right, baby<br>
				If you just stay, stay with me<br>
				'Cause I'm chained<br>
				Oh I'm chained to your love and affection<br>
				Yes I'm chained<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">I Heard It Through The Grapevine</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)</div>
			<p>Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew<br>
				'bout you're plans to make me blue<br>
				with some other guy that you knew before. <br>
				Between the two of us guys<br>
				you know I love you more.<br>
				It took me by surprise I must say, <br>
				when I found out yesterday. <br>
				Don't you know that...</p>
			<p>Chorus:<br>
				I heard it through the grapevine<br>
				not much longer would you be mine.<br>
				Oh I heard it through the grapevine, <br>
				Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind. <br>
				Honey, honey yeah. </p>
			<p>I know that a man ain't supposed to cry, <br>
				but these tears I can't hold inside.<br>
				Losin' you would end my life you see,<br>
				cause you mean that much to me.<br>
				You could have told me yourself<br>
				that you love someone else. <br>
				Instead...</p>
			<p>Chorus</p>
			<p>People say believe half of what you see, <br>
				son, and none of what you hear.<br>
				I can't help bein' confused<br>
				if it's true please tell me dear?<br>
				Do you plan to let me go<br>
				for the other guy you loved before?<br>
				Don't you know...</p>
			<p>chorus</p>

			<h2 id="fx_7">Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever</h2>
			<div>(Stevie Wonder/Ivy Jo Hunter)</div>
			<p>I remember yet before we met<br>
				When every night and day<br>
				I had to live the life of a lonely one.<br>
				And I remember meeting you,<br>
				Discovering love could be so true<br>
				When shared by two, 'stead of only one.</p>
			<p>When you said you loved me<br>
				And we could not be parted.<br>
				Then I built my world around you<br>
				Every since I found you</p>
			<p>Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.<br>
				Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.</p>
			<p>Each night I pray we'll never part<br>
				Because the love within my heart<br>
				Grows stronger from day to day.<br>
				As best I can, I've always tried<br>
				To reassure and satisfy.<br>
				You know I'd be lost if you went away.</p>
			<p>When you said you loved me<br>
				And we could not be parted.<br>
				Right then I built my world around you<br>
				Every since I found you</p>
			<p>Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.<br>
				Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.</p>
			<p>When you said you loved me<br>
				And we could not be parted.<br>
				I built my world around you<br>
				Every since I found you</p>
			<p>Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.<br>
				Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.</p>

			<h2 id="fx_12">There Goes My Baby</h2>
			<div>(Patterson/Treadwell/Nelson)</div>
			<p>(Bo-bo, doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
				(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
				(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
				(Bo-bo) (doo-doot-doo-doo)<br>
				(Bo-bo) (doo-doo-doo-doo)</p>
			<p>There goes my baby, movin' on down the line<br>
				Wonder where, wonder where, wonder where she is bound?<br>
				I broke her heart and made her cry<br>
				Now I'm alone, so all alone<br>
				What can I do, what can I do?</p>
			<p>(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
				(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
				(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
				(There she goes) Yeah! (There she goes)</p>
			<p>I wanna know if she loved me<br>
				Did she really love me?<br>
				Was she just playing me for a fool?</p>
			<p>I wonder why she left me<br>
				Why did she leave me so all alone<br>
				So all alone</p>
			<p>I was gonna tell her that I loved her<br>
				And that I need her<br>
				Beside my side to be my guide</p>
			<p>I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
				Where is my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo) ?<br>
				I want my baby<br>
				I need my baby</p>
			<p>Yeah, whoa-oh-oh</p>
			<p>(There goes my baby)<br>
				Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh</p>
