          <div>(Clarence Paul/Dave Hamilton/William &#8220;Mickey&#8221; Stevenson/Barney Ales)</div>
          <p>Once upon a time I almost lost my mind<br>
               I was lonely, so lonely<br>
               Once upon a time</p>
          <p>Hoping every day things would go my way<br>
               Then you came into my life<br>
               Now everything is fine</p>
          <p>I never knew what love could do till I met you<br>
               Now everything is oh so cozy<br>
               Now my skies are blue all because of you<br>
               I'm so glad; I was lonely<br>
               Once upon a time</p>

               Whenever you're in sight</p>
          <p>Je t'aime toi<br>
               Pour raisons sentimentales<br>

          <h2 id="fx_10">You Came A Long Way From St. Louis</h2>
          <div>(Bob Russell/John Benson Brooks)</div>
          <p>You came a long way from St. Louis,<br>
               you climbed the ladder of success,<br>
               I've seen the town and country cars<br>
               that were parked out in front of your fancy address.</p>
          <p>You came a long way from St. Louis,<br>
               you broke a lotta hearts between,<br>
               I've seen a gang of gloomy gals<br>
               who were doing alright till you came on the scene.</p>
          <p>You came here from the middle west,<br>
               and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.<br>
               Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.<br>
               So natcherly I got my doubts, you got 'em dropping by the wayside,<br>
               A feeling I ain't gonna know.</p>
          <p>You came a long way from St. Louis,<br>
               but baby, you still got a long way to go.</p>
