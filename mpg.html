			<h2 id="fx_1">Too Busy Thinking About My Baby</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong/Janie Bradford)</div>
			<p>Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah... Oh listen to me people</p>
			<p>I ain't got time to think about money<br>
				Or what it can buy<br>
				And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder<br>
				What makes a birdie fly</p>
			<p>And I don't have the time to think about<br>
				What makes a flower grow<br>
				And I've never given a second thought<br>
				To where the rivers flow</p>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				Too busy thinking about my baby<br>
				And I ain't got time for nothing else</p>
			<p>Said, I ain't got time to discuss the weather<br>
				How long it's gonna last<br>
				And I ain't got time to do no studies<br>
				Once I get out of class<br>
				Tellin ya I'm just a fellow<br>
				Said I got a one track mind<br>
				And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby<br>
				I just don't have any time</p>
			<p>CHORUS</p>
			<p>The diamonds and pearls in the world<br>
				Could never match her worth, no no<br>
				She's some kind of wonderful, people tell ya<br>
				I got heaven right here on earth<br>
				I'm just a fellow<br>
				With a one, one track mind<br>
				And when it comes to thinkin' about anything but my baby<br>
				I just don't have any time</p>
			<p>CHORUS</p>
			<p>(yeah, she's never hard to find<br>
				'cause she's always on my mind)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">That's the Way Love Is</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)</div>
			<p>Ah baby<br>
				After many tears fall from your eyes<br>
				A thousand times you ask yourself why<br>
				The one guy you love has departed<br>
				You're left alone and broken-hearted<br>
				Love just comes and goes<br>
				How long it's gonna last nobody knows</p>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				That's the way love is, baby [or honey, or other endearing term]<br>
				(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)<br>
				That's the way love is, baby<br>
				(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)<br>
				That's how it is</p>
			<p>I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road<br>
				And your heart is carryin' a heavy load<br>
				I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (ain't got a friend)<br>
				And your whole world's cavin' in (cavin' in)<br>
				Ah, but now is the time to be strong (to be strong)<br>
				You better forget him now that he's gone (now that he's gone)<br>
				Remember...</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>(instrumental)</p>
			<p>Listen to me, little darlin'<br>
				The road of love is rough sometimes<br>
				But don't let it get the best of you<br>
				I've been hurt by love so many times<br>
				I know just what you're goin' through<br>
				You wish you were never born<br>
				You better forget him now that he's gone</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>Wipe away your tears<br>
				Love is here today and gone tomorrow<br>
				(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)<br>
				All your joys turn to sorrow<br>
				(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)<br>
				One day gladness, and the next day sadness<br>
				(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">The End Of Our Road</h2>
			<div>(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong/Roger Penzabene</div>
			<p>Oh, it's over, it's all over<br>
				Said it's over, it's all over, baby<br>
				I gotta get away from you as fast as I can<br>
				You're too much for me, woman<br>
				More than my heart can stand<br>
				Like a kid behind the wheel<br>
				You've been reckless with my heart<br>
				If I stayed around<br>
				You'd surely tear it all apart</p>
			<p>The road has got to end somewhere<br>
				Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere<br>
				Now is the time for the showdown<br>
				So let me give you the lowdown<br>
				We've come to the end of our road</p>
			<p>Woman, I'm just thinkin' 'bout all the times you promised to call<br>
				and I sat at home lonely<br>
				You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only<br>
				Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town<br>
				I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown</p>
			<p>The road has got to end somewhere<br>
				Every road has got to end somewhere<br>
				I'm tired of your stuff<br>
				Say enough is enough<br>
				We've come to the end of our road<br>
				I can't take it no more</p>
			<p>Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'<br>
				To hold on when I'm the one you're leavin'<br>
				Say I've 'bout had my fill of you (had my fill of you)<br>
				Flirtin's all through the years<br>
				And I've almost run out of tears<br>
				I'm tellin' you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to</p>
			<p>The road has got to end somewhere<br>
				Every road has got to end somewhere<br>
				Time and again I've begged you to slow down<br>
				So I'm givin' you the lowdown<br>
				We've come to the end of our road, road, road</p>
			<p>(repeat and fade):<br>
				(Oh, this is the end, the end of our road)</p>
