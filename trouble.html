			<h2 id="fx_6">Trouble Man</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm cool<br>
				I didn't make it surely, playin' by the rules<br>
				I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm fine<br>
				I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line<br>
				I've come of heart, baby, but that's OK<br>
				'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way</p>
			<p>I've come of heart, baby<br>
				I've been for real, baby<br>
				Gonna keep movin', gonna roll to town<br>
				I've come of heart, come on, get down<br>
				There's only 3 things for sure:<br>
				Taxes, death and trouble</p>
			<p>This I know, baby, this I know, child<br>
				Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby<br>
				Get me singin', yeah, yeah, ooo</p>
			<p>I've come of heart, baby, I had to fight<br>
				Took him on madness with all my might<br>
				I've come of heart, I had to win<br>
				Then start all over and then again<br>
				I've come of heart, but that's OK<br>
				'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way</p>
			<p>I've heard some places and I've seen some places<br>
				I've never had tensions, I give my directions<br>
				When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me<br>
				I'm ready to make it, don't care 'bout the weather<br>
				Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together<br>
				No laughin', no cryin', protection's all around me</p>
			<p>I've come of heart, baby<br>
				I've been for real, baby<br>
				With the Trouble Man<br>
				Movin', goin' tight<br>
				I've come of heart, come on, get down<br>
				There's only 3 things for sure:<br>
				Taxes, death and trouble</p>
			<p>This I know, baby, baby<br>
				This I know, baby, baby<br>
				Hey now, let it sweat, baby</p>
			<p>I've come of heart, but now I'm cool<br>
				I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules<br>
				I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm fine<br>
				I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line</p>
