			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>I used to go out to parties<br>
				And stand around<br>
				'Cause I was too nervous<br>
				To really get down<br>
				And my body yearned to be free<br>
				So I got up on the floor and found<br>
				Someone to choose me<br>
				No more standin' along the side walls<br>
				Now I've got myself together, baby<br>
				And I'm havin' a ball<br>
				Long as you prove it<br>
				There's always a chance<br>
				Somebody watches<br>
				I'm gonna make romance<br>
				With your body, ooo baby, you dance all night<br>
				Get down and prove it, feel all right<br>
				. . . .<br>
				(repeat and fade):<br>
				Keep on dancin'<br>
				Got to give it up</p>
