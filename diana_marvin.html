			<h2 id="fx_1">You Are Everything</h2>
			<div>(T. Bell/L. Creed)</div>
			<p>Oh darling<br>
				I want to be everything to you</p>
			<p>Today I saw somebody<br>
				Who looked just like you<br>
				He walked like you do<br>
				I thought it was you<br>
				As he turned the corner<br>
				I called out your name<br>
				I felt so ashamed<br>
				When it wasn't you<br>
				Wasn't you</p>
			<p>You are everything<br>
				And everything is you<br>
				Oh, you are everything<br>
				And everything is you<br>
				'Cause you are everything<br>
				And everything is you</p>
			<p>How can I forget<br>
				When each face that I see<br>
				Brings back memories<br>
				Of being with you<br>
				I just can't go on<br>
				Living life as I do<br>
				Comparing each girl with you<br>
				Knowing they just won't do<br>
				They're not you</p>
			<p>'Cause you are everything<br>
				And everything is you<br>
				Oh, you are everything<br>
				And everything is you<br>
				You are everything<br>
				And everything is you</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Don't Knock My Love</h2>
			<div>(B. Shapiro/W. Pickett)</div>
			<p>Don't knock my love<br>
				Don't hold you up,<br>
				And my kisses don't set your stuff<br>
				Don't be afraid, to let me know,<br>
				There's other places woman, that i can go<br>
				If you don't like it (don't like it),<br>
				Don't knock it, (don't knock it)<br>
				Somebody else (somebody) might want to rock it<br>
				If you don't need it (don't need it),<br>
				Don't waste it (don't waste it)<br>
				Somebody else (somebody) might want to taste it.</p>
			<p>If my thrill, don't turn you on,<br>
				And my will baby, is much to strong<br>
				Don't waste my time with your foolish ways,<br>
				I got other things to do with my days<br>
				If you don't like it (don't like it),<br>
				Don't knock it, (don't knock it)<br>
				Somebody else (somebody) might want to rock it.<br>
				If you don't need it (don't need it),<br>
				Don't waste it (don't waste it)<br>
				Somebody else (somebody) might want to taste it.</p>
			<p>Bridge:<br>
				Going up, going down, going all way around town,<br>
				I'm the one, that turn you on,<br>
				I'm the same one to leave you alone.<br>
				Don't knock my love, don't knock my love,<br>
				Don't knock my love.</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">You're a Special Part of Me</h2>
			<div>(G. Wright/H. Johnson/A. Porter)</div>
			<p>That special tear I shed means you're a part of me,<br>
				thoughts of you running through my head means you're a part of me.<br>
				I'm satisfied to know you're a spart of me.<br>
				What I want to say is...<br>
				all I want to say is...(ooo)<br>
				is that I love you, 'cause you're that very special part of me</p>
			<p>(ohhh baby) (oww) Everytime I look into your eyes (eyes baby), <br>
				can't you see what you mean to me (talk to me) <br>
				(woo) and everytime you hear me speak your name (ohh baby),<br>
				can't you tell, what you mean to me (wooo),</p>
			<p>Can't move the moon, can't stop the passing time<br>
				and it's plain by now you can't move this love of mine.<br>
				Just as simple as a nursery rhyme.<br>
				What I want to say is...<br>
				all I want to say is...<br>
				is that I love you <br>
				'cause you're that very special part of me...oooo.</p>
			<p>When the morning comes I wipe the sleep from my eyes,<br>
				well, I can't wipe away what I feel inside.<br>
				Can't find the cure for not having you around (sugar)<br>
				(ohh) I've searched far and near but true love just can't be found (no, no)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_9">My Mistake (Was To Love You)</h2>
			<div>(Pamela Sawyer/Gloria Jones)</div>
			<p>My mistake was to love you, girl<br>
				Love you, girl<br>
				My mistake was to give you all<br>
				Tell the world</p>
			<p>First I had you<br>
				In the palm of my hand<br>
				But I let you slip through<br>
				Like rain to sand<br>
				At the beginning<br>
				When I didn't care<br>
				Like my own reflection<br>
				You were always there</p>
			<p>My mistake was to love you, girl<br>
				Love you, girl<br>
				My mistake was to give you all<br>
				Tell the world</p>
			<p>You were sweeter<br>
				Then my very own skin<br>
				But what did I do for you<br>
				Not a thing<br>
				In front of my friends<br>
				You broke me down<br>
				Since then darling<br>
				It's hard to track you down</p>
			<p>My mistake was to love you, boy<br>
				Love you, boy<br>
				My mistake was to give my all<br>
				Tell the world</p>
			<p>Many a smile<br>
				You put om ny face<br>
				But I paid dearly<br>
				With the tears I taste</p>
			<p>My tenderness<br>
				Made you cold, not sweet<br>
				'Cause if a girl loves you<br>
				You only call her weak</p>
			<p>My mistake was to love you, boy<br>
				Love you, boy<br>
				My mistake was to give my all<br>
				Tell the world</p>
			<p>My mistake was to love you, girl<br>
				Love you, girl<br>
				My mistake was to give you all<br>
				Tell the world</p>
