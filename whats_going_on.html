			<div>(Al Cleveland/Marvin Gaye/Renaldo Benson)</div>
			<p>Mother, mother<br>
				There's too many of you crying<br>
				Brother, brother, brother<br>
				There's far too many of you dying<br>
				You know we've got to find a way<br>
				To bring some lovin' here today - Ya</p>
			<p>Father, father<br>
				We don't need to escalate<br>
				You see, war is not the answer<br>
				For only love can conquer hate<br>
				You know we've got to find a way<br>
				To bring some lovin' here today</p>
			<p>Picket lines and picket signs<br>
				Don't punish me with brutality<br>
				Talk to me, so you can see<br>
				Oh, what's going on<br>

				Right on, baby<br>
				Right on<br>
				Right on</p>
			<p>Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong<br>
				Oh, but who are they to judge us<br>
				Simply because our hair is long<br>
				Oh, you know we've got to find a way<br>
				To bring some understanding here today
				Oh</p>
			<p>Picket lines and picket signs<br>
				Don't punish me with brutality<br>
				Talk to me<br>
				So you can see<br>
				What's going on<br>
				Ya, what's going on<br>
				Tell me what's going on<br>
				I'll tell you what's going on - Uh<br>
				Right on baby<br>
				Right on baby</p>

			<div>(Marvin Gaye/James Nyx)</div>
			<p>Hey baby, what'cha know good<br>
				I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would<br>
				War is hell, when will it end,<br>
				When will people start gettin' together again<br>
				Are things really gettin' better, like the newspaper said<br>
				What else is new my friend, besides what I read<br>
				Can't find no work, can't find no job my friend<br>
				Money is tighter than it's ever been<br>
				Say man, I just don't understand<br>
				What's going on across this land<br>
				Ah what's happening brother,<br>
				Oh ya, what's happening my man<br>
				Are they still gettin' down where we used to go and dance<br>
				Will our ball club win the pennant, <br>
				do you think they have a chance<br>
				And tell me friend, how in the world have you been.<br>
				Tell me what's out and I want to know what's in.<br>
				What's the deal man, what's happening<br>
				What's happening brother<br>
				Ah what's happening brother<br>
				What's happening my man<br>
				Ah what's happening brother<br>
				What's been shaken up and down the line<br>
				I want to know cause I'm slightly behind the time.</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Flyin' High</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye/Anna Gaye/Elgie Stover)</div>
			<p>Flying high in the friendly sky<br>
				Flying high without ever leavin' the ground, no<br>
				Rest of the folks are tired and weary<br>
				Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down.<br>
				I go the place where danger awaits me <br>
				and it's bound to forsake me.<br>
				So stupid minded.<br>
				I can't help it<br>
				oh ya, so stupid minded.<br>
				But I go crazy when I can't find it,<br>
				In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend.<br>
				But soon the night will bring the pains,<br>
				The pain, oh the pain<br>
				Flying high in the friendly sky<br>
				Without ever leaving the ground<br>
				And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby<br>
				Nobody really understands, no no<br>
				And I go to the place where the good feelin' awaits me<br>
				Selfdestruction in my hand<br>
				Oh Lord, so stupid minded<br>
				Oh and I go crazy when I can't find it<br>
				Well I know I'm hooked my friend<br>
				To the boy who makes slaves out of men.<br>
				And oh beleive me<br>
				Flying high in a friendly sky<br>
				Oh baby, flyin' high</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">Save The Children</h2>
			<div>(Al Cleveland/Marvin Gaye/Renaldo Benson)</div>
			<p>I just want to ask a question<br>
				Who really cares?<br>
				To save a world in despair<br>
				There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'<br>
				Flowers won't grow, bells won't be ringin'<br>
				Who really cares?<br>
				Who's willing to try to save a world<br>
				That's destined to die<br>
				When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow<br>
				Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow<br>
				Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live<br>
				All who is to blame, we can't stop livin'<br>
				Live, live for life<br>
				But let live everybody<br>
				Live life for the children<br>
				Oh, for the children<br>
				You see, let's save the children<br>
				Let's save all the children<br>
				Save the babies, save the babies<br>
				If you wanna love, you got to save the babies<br>
				All of the children<br>
				But who really cares<br>
				Who's willing to try<br>
				Yes, to save a world<br>
				Yea, save our sweet world<br>
				Save a world that is destined to die<br>
				Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
				Oh, oh dig it everybody</p>

			<h2 id="fx_5">God Is Love</h2>

				Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas, fish full of mercury<br>

				With money to spend<br>
				Some of us were born<br>
				For races to win<br>
				Some of us are aware<br>
				That it's good for us to care<br>
				Some of us feel the icy wind<br>
				Of poverty blowing in the air<br>
				For those of us who simply like to socialize<br>
				For those of us who tend the sick<br>
				Ah, and heed the people's cries<br>
				Let me say to you<br>
				Right on<br>
				Right on, feel it<br>
				Yea, oh, oh, Oh Lord, Lord, people<br>
				And I say, Right on<br>
				Honey right on<br>
				For those of us who live<br>
				Where peace is craved<br>
				For those of us who live, uh-huh<br>
				Where hatred is enslaved, alright<br>
				For those of us who live a life<br>
				Yea, surrounded by good fortune and wealth<br>
				Talk about it<br>
				Those of us who live a life<br>
				Hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves<br>
				For those of us who got drowned<br>
				In the sea of happiness<br>
				For the soul that takes pride in his God<br>
				And himself and everything else<br>
				Love<br>
				That's all it is<br>
				We need love<br>
				That's all it is<br>
				Oh, oh<br>
				Love, love<br>
				Love's the thing<br>
				Love, love, love, love<br>
				Sweet love, love<br>
				Wonderful love<br>

				Love, for God<br>
				Pure love<br>
				Love can conquer hate everytime<br>
				Give out some love and you'll find<br>
				Peace sublime<br>
				And my darling, one more thing<br>
				If you let me, I will take you<br>
				To live where love is King<br>
				Ah, ah baby, baby<br>
