			<p>Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>
			<p>I got your picture hangin' on the wall<br>
				It can't see or come to me when I call your name<br>
				I realize it's just a picture in a frame</p>
			<p>I read your letters when you're not near<br>
				But they don't move me<br>
				And they don't groove me like when I hear<br>
				Your sweet voice whispering in my ear</p>
			<p>Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>
			<p>I play the game, a fantasy<br>
				I pretend I'm not in reality<br>
				I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me</p>
			<p>No other sound is quite the same as your name<br>
				No touch can do half as much to make me feel better<br>
				So let's stay together</p>
			<p>I got some memories to look back on<br>
				And though they help me when you phone<br>
				I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there</p>
			<p>So let me get the real thing<br>
				So let me get the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>
