		<h1>Romantically Yours</h1>

		<h2 id="fx_1">More</h2>
		<div>(Norman Newell/R. Ortolani/N. Oliviero)</div>
		<p>More than the greatest love the world has known<br>
			this is the love I'll give to you alone.<br>
			More than the simple words I try to say<br>
			I only live to love you more each day...</p>
		<p>More than you'll ever know<br>
			my arms long to hold you so,<br>
			my life will be in your keeping<br>
			waking.. sleeping... laughing... weeping....</p>
		<p>Longer than always is a long long time<br>
			but far beyond forever you'll be mine,<br>
			I know I never lived before<br>
			and my heart is very sure<br>
			no one else could love you more.</p>

		<h2 id="fx_3">Maria</h2>
		<div>(Leonard Bernstein/Stephen Sondheim)</div>
		<p>The most beautiful sound I ever heard:<br>
			Maria. Maria.<br>
			All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word<br>
			Maria. Maria. Maria. Maria...<br>
			I've just met a girl named Maria<br>
			And suddenly that name<br>
			Will never be the same<br>
			To me.<br>
			Maria!<br>
			I've just kissed a girl named Maria<br>
			And suddenly I've found<br>
			How wonderful a sound<br>
			Can be!<br>
			Maria!<br>
			Say it loud and there's music playing,<br>
			Say it soft and it's almost like praying<br>
			Maria!<br>
			I'll never stop saying Maria!<br>
			The most beautiful sound I ever heard<br>
			Maria</p>

		<h2 id="fx_5">Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)</h2>
		<p>Fly me to the moon<br>
			And let me play amongst the stars<br>
			Let me know what spring is like<br>
			On Jupiter and Mars</p>
		<p>In other words, hold my hand<br>
			In other words, baby kiss me</p>
		<p>Fill my heart with song<br>
			And let me sing for ever more<br>
			You are all I long for<br>
			All I cherish and adore</p>
		<p>In other words, please be true<br>
			In other words, I love you</p>
		<p>Fill my heart with song<br>
			And let me sing for ever more<br>
			You are all I long for<br>
			All I cherish and adore</p>
		<p>In other words, please be true<br>
			In other words, I love you</p>
