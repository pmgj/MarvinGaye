				Soon as we come out we'll be high soon<br>
				Did you save a line for the ladies<br>
				We're not into that are you crazy<br>
				Who's the super freak in the red dress<br>
				When she starts to shake it, I can't take it<br>
				Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby<br>
				Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby<br>
				Shake it baby, shake it pretty<br>
				We got the party, we got the sounds<br>
				We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down<br>
				Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat<br>
				Shake, shake your thing<br>

				I had to stop<br>
				I got the rhythm<br>
				I got the rhythm<br>
				Love is everywhere for the making<br>
				Freaks is everywhere for the taking<br>
				Blues is in the air if you sing it<br>
				Happiness come back if you bring it<br>
				I'm having me a good time</p>
