		<h2 id="fx_8">Just To Keep You Satisfied</h2>
		<div>(Marvin Gaye/Anna Gaye/Elgie Stover)</div>
		<p>You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams<br>
			For you to understand what this means, I shall explain<br>
			I stood all the jealousy, all the bitchin' too<br>
			Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you<br>
			Ooo darling how could we end up like this?<br>
			Oh baby let me reminisce</p>
		<p>Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time<br>
			You set my soul on fire, my one desire<br>
			Was to love you and think of you with pride<br>
			And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby<br>
			We could not bear the mental strain<br>
			Leave you, I laugh at men too<br>
			Now you see how much you hurt me<br>
			But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side<br>
			Though the many happy times we had<br>
			Can never really outweigh the bad<br>
			Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby</p>
		<p>It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darlin'<br>
			Maybe we'll meet down the line<br>
			It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I<br>
			Much too late for you to cry<br>
			It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I<br>
			It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby<br>
			Ah we tried, God knows we tried<br>
			Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby<br>
			It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry<br>
			Oh oh ohhh it's much too late<br>
			Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy</p>
