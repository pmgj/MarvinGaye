			<h1>Here, My Dear</h1>

			<h2 id="fx_1">Here, My Dear</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>I guess I don't have to say this album is<br>
				dedicated to you.<br>
				Although perhaps you may not be happy,<br>
				this is what you want,<br>
				so I conceded.<br>
				I hope it makes you happy.<br>
				There's a lot of truth in it, babe.</p>
			<p>I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.<br>
				Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.<br>
				You don't have the right to use the son of mine<br>
				to keep me in line.<br>
				One thing I can't do without<br>
				is the boy whom God gave to both of us.<br>
				I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.</p>
			<p>So here it is, babe.<br>
				I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,<br>
				think about the kisses and the joy.<br>
				But there were those other moments too,<br>
				the times that were cloudy and grey.<br>
				Bad.<br>
				But you taught me that was life.<br>
				May love ever protect you,<br>
				may peace come into your life.<br>
				Always think of me the way I was.<br>
				Ha, I was your baby.</p>
			<p>This is what you wanted.<br>
				Here, dear, here it is.<br>
				Here, my dear, here it is.</p>

			<h2 id="fx_2">I Met A Little Girl</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>I met a little girl, sure was fine<br>
				Pretty little thing just about blew my mind<br>
				She took me home and ahh made love to me<br>
				I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be<br>
				Most of my life I had been all, all alone<br>
				And you're so sweet to me, don't think i'll ever roam<br>
				And then one day as time will pass<br>
				I had this feeling that our love would last<br>
				Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did <br>
				Seemed to please you, all the heartaches you hid</p>
			<p>Then one night after we made it, and we were through<br>
				That's when I decided I wanted to marry you</p>
			<p>Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife <br>
				To love, hold and cherish for the rest of your life?<br>
				I do, yes I do, I do darlin' <br>
				'Cause I love you</p>
			<p>1964</p>
			<p>Once you really loved me<br>
				Once I really loved you</p>
			<p>1976</p>
			<p>Then time would change you <br>
				As time would really change me<br>
				We thought our love would stand the test of time<br>
				And as I sing this song right now I wonder today, today <br>
				If you're a friend of mine</p>
			<p>Cry cry cyr-I have done some crying<br>
				Woman, you have caused my tears to flow<br>
				Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?<br>
				Dou you think about the kind of love we had?</p>
			<p>Hal le hallelejah <br>
				Hal le lu i'm free<br>
				Hal le hallelejah<br>
				Hal le lu i'm free<br>
				(crying and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye)</div>
			<p>You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean...<br>
				if you think back about what you really said, what it's all about, honor, loving and<br>
				obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should...it<br>
				should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what<br>
				you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed</p>
			<p>Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times<br>
				Again and again and again, and that isn't all<br>
				I gave my love to you each time to make amends<br>
				Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it<br>
				Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake<br>
				What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever<br>
				So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again<br>
				Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you<br>
				With all my heart as long as you want me to baby</p>
			<p>Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time<br>
				Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid<br>
				So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger<br>
				Do you remember all of the fights we had?<br>
				You say you love me with all your heart<br>
				If you ever loved me will all of your heart<br>
				You'd never take $1 million to part<br>
				I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby<br>
				Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies<br>
				I really tried, you know how I tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?<br>
				And on top of that you have scared the life, my name<br>
				But I can't understand, 'cause if you love me<br>
				How could you turn me into nothin' least<br>
				Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?<br>
				Best I could, you were so inviting and your love was like mellow wine<br>
				Pains of love, miles of tears, after lasting for my lifetime<br>
				Broken hearts last for years and break away to the blue-day sunshine<br>
				One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again<br>
				But we're not really bitter babe<br>
				I promise you all the love in the world, good love in the world<br>
				But I know you'll never be satisfied just to have me by your side<br>
				Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave, you're mine<br>
				God judged me on His side; you've said bad things and you've lied<br>
				Still I remember some of the good things baby<br>
				Of love after dark and picnics in parks<br>
				Those are the days I'd love to get in my life<br>
				I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe<br>
				I'd rather remember all the fun we had<br>
				All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right<br>
				All we did was fuss and fight<br>
				It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all<br>
				I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me through<br>
				You try your best, you say I gave you no rest</p>
			<p>(repeat and fade):<br>
				When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">Anger</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye/Delta Ashby/Ed Townsend)</div>
			<p>Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain<br>
				It injures me, babe....</p>
			<p>Anger, can make you old, yes it can<br>
				I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus<br>
				Anger destroys your soul<br>
				Rage, there's no room for rage in there<br>
				There's no room for rage in here<br>
				line up some place to go to be mad <br>
				It's a sin to treat your body bad</p>
			<p>When anger really gets the best of us<br>
				We've really lost our heads<br>
				We often say a lof of things, oh darlin'<br>
				Wish we'd never said<br>
				Oh, reason is beyond control<br>
				And the things we do spite<br>
				Makes me ashamed<br>
				And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right</p>
			<p>Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus<br>
				I'll reach that wiser age<br>
				Hope I will learn I really never never profit <br>
				From things I do in rage</p>
			<p>One more time-anger, more ager<br>
				When it's flaming hot<br>
				Anger burns to the bitter end<br>
				Know what i'm talkin' 'bout<br>
				When it cools I find out too late<br>
				I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend<br>
				I said, anger will make you sick,<br>
				children, oh Jesus<br>
				Anger destroys your soul</p>
			<p>I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe<br>
				I'm gonna go somewhere and cool<br>
				This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe<br>
				You've got me feelin' like some silly fool <br>
				But I know a real nice place where I can go<br>
				And feel the way i'm supposed to feel</p>
			<p>I don't want to be mad at nobody<br>
				I don't want to be feelin' bad<br>
				Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain<br>
				It injures me, babe</p>
			<p>Anger, can make you old, yes it can<br>
				I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus<br>
				Anger destroys your soul<br>
				Anger <br>
				Anger</p>

			<h2 id="fx_12">You Can Leave, But It's Going to Cost You</h2>
			<p>I remember like it was yesterday<br>
				we were over Gwen's, and we were trying one more time to make amends<br>
				Oh yes we were<br>
				Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter<br>
				whether I was mad at her<br>
				or she was at me<br>
				Nawww understanding my condition I must surely be a wishing and a hoping to be free</p>
			<p>Chorus</p>
			<p>She said... You can leave, but it's going to cost you ....<br>
				She said... You can leave,but it's going to cost you.<br>
				She said ... you can lea..ve, but it's gonna cost you dearly<br>
				you....can leave but it gonna cost you how dearly<br>
				Ooohhhhhhhhh<br>
				Sometimes my eyes were red as fire<br>
				Intoxicated ...</p>
			<p>Sometimes the spirit was moving on me<br>
				I had to fight to defend my life</p>
			<p>I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone (get use to it baby)<br>
				I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone (get use to it baby)</p>
			<p>You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man...<br>
				that didn't help me baby Ah...when you were on the stand</p>
