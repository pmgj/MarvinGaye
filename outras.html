			<h2 id="fx_1">Teach Me Tonight</h2>
			<div>(S. Cahn/G. DePaul)</div>
			<p>(with Kim Weston)<br>
				(can be found nowadays on the Kim Weston disc _Greatest Hits and Rare Classics_; Mary Wells also sang a
				version by herself)</p>
			<p>Did you say I've got a lot to learn?<br>
				Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn<br>
				Since this is the perfect spot to learn<br>
				Teach me tonight</p>
			<p>Starting with the ABC of it<br>
				Right down to the XYZ of it<br>
				Help me solve the mystery of it<br>
				Teach me tonight</p>
			<p>The sky's a blackboard high above you<br>
				If a shooting star goes by<br>
				I'll use that star to write &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br>
				1000 times across the sky</p>
			<p>One thing isn't very clear, my love<br>
				Should the teacher stand so near, my love?<br>
				Graduation's almost here, my love<br>
				Teach me tonight</p>

			<h2 id="fx_2">Baby, Don't You Leave Me</h2>
			<div>(Clarence Paul)</div>
			<p>(with Kim Weston)<br>
				(can be found on the Kim disc Greatest Hits &amp; Rare Classics)</p>
			<p>Baby, don't you leave me<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me<br>
				Don't you break my heart<br>
				Why you wanna leave me?<br>
				Why you wanna grieve me?<br>
				Why do we have to part<br>
				Couldn't give my love to nobody else<br>
				You've got me feelin' sorry for myself<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me</p>
			<p>Baby, I'm lonely<br>
				Oh, so lonely<br>
				When you left me before<br>
				That's when you promised<br>
				Oh yes, you promised<br>
				Not to leave me no more<br>
				You oughta hang your head in shame<br>
				The way you keep my little heart in pain<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me</p>
			<p>Said you'd never let nothin' come between you and me<br>
				I'm yours and I guess I'll be yours till you set me free</p>
			<p>Don't leave me<br>
				Please don't leave me<br>
				Don't you make me cry<br>
				Let's stay together<br>
				Always together<br>
				Till the day we die<br>
				You know you're comin' out hard to wait<br>
				You're gonna fool around and make it great?<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me<br>
				Don't leave me, baby<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me<br>
				Please don't go<br>
				Baby, don't you leave me<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Can I Get A Witness?</h2>
			<div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
			<p>Listen everybody, especially you girls<br>
				Is it right to be left alone<br>
				While the one you love is never home?<br>
				I love too hard, my friends sometimes say<br>
				But I believe, I believe<br>
				That a woman should be loved that way<br>
				But it hurts me so inside<br>
				To see her treat me so unkind<br>
				Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair</p>
			<p>Can I get a witness?<br>
				Can I get a witness?<br>
				Can I get a witness?<br>
				Somebody</p>
			<p>Is it right to be treated so bad<br>
				When you've given everything you had?<br>
				Even tossin' in my sleep<br>
				'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week<br>
				Now, you chicks do agree<br>
				That this ain't the way love's supposed to be<br>
				Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah</p>
			<p>Up early in the morning with her on my mind<br>
				Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'<br>
				But I believe a woman's a man's best friend<br>
				So I'm gonna stick by her till the very end<br>
				But she causes so much misery I forget how<br>
				Love is supposed to be<br>
				Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair</p>
			<p>Can I get a witness?<br>
				I want a witness<br>
				Witness, witness<br>
				Witness, witness</p>
			<p>Everybody knows, especially you girls<br>
				Love can be sad<br>
				But I have a love that's twice as bad<br>
				Now all you chicks agree<br>
				That this ain't the way its's supposed to be<br>
				Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah</p>
			<p>I want a witness<br>
				I want a witness<br>
				I want a witness<br>
				I want a witness</p>
			<p>...</p>

			<h2 id="fx_4">You're the Man</h2>
			<div>(Marvin Gaye/Kenneth Stover)</div>
			<p>Talkin', talkin' to the people<br>
				Tryin' to get them to go your way<br>
				Tellin' lies, not to worry<br>
				That we won't be led astray<br>
				So blind, unsignified<br>
				Your opponents always lying<br>
				Think about the mistakes you make<br>
				I believe America's at stake<br>
				You know, busin', busin' is the issue<br>
				If you have a plan wager<br>
				If you have a plan<br>
				If you've got a master plan<br>
				Got to vote for you<br>
				Hey hey, got to vote for you<br>
				You're the man</p>
			<p>We don't wanna hear no more lies<br>
				About how you planned a compromise<br>
				We want our dollar value increased<br>
				Employment to rise<br>
				The nation's taxation<br>
				Is causin' all, all this inflation<br>
				Don't give us no V sign<br>
				Turn around and rob the people blind<br>
				Economics is the issue<br>
				Do you have a plan wager?<br>
				'Cause if you've got a master plan<br>
				Got to vote for you<br>
				You're the man</p>
			<p>(8 times, over scat singing):<br>
				Don't you understand?<br>
				There's misery in the land<br>
				(One version fades out during this; read further for a longer version)</p>
			<p>People marching on Washington<br>
				Better hear what they have to say<br>
				'Cause the tables just might turn against you, brother<br>
				Set around Election Day<br>
				Politics and hypocrites<br>
				Is turning us all into lunatics<br>
				Can you take the guns from our sons?<br>
				Right all the wrongs this administration has done?<br>
				Peace and freedom is the issue<br>
				Do you have a plan wager?<br>
				If you've got a plan<br>
				If you've got a master plan<br>
				Got to vote for you<br>
				Hey hey, got to vote for you<br>
				'Cause you're the man</p>
			<p>(repeat and fade):<br>
				Got to vote for you</p>

			<h2 id="fx_5">Pretty Little Baby</h2>
			<div>(Clarence Paul/Marvin Gaye/Dave Hamilton)</div>
			<p>Darling, please stay, don't go away<br>
				(If you leave me)<br>
				What a heartache, for heaven's sake<br>
				(Don't you need me?)<br>
				Don't leave me blue of wanting you<br>
				(How could I live?)<br>
				Don't be untrue, what could I do?</p>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				(Don't you know you)<br>
				You gave me the world, little girl<br>
				When you gave me your love<br>
				So if you take your love<br>
				You take my world with you too</p>
			<p>Hey look at me, now can't you see<br>
				(Tears in my eyes)<br>
				Hear what I say, stay here, I pray<br>
				(Never leave me)<br>
				Why must I plead, you know I need<br>
				(All your loving)<br>
				Don't put me down, keep me around</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>And I say, baby, pretty little baby<br>
				Don't leave me<br>
				Baby, pretty little baby</p>
			<p>Darlin', you give me your joy, am I your toy<br>
				(Cracked and broken)<br>
				I always share your every care<br>
				(Wishin', hopin')<br>
				All through the years we have no fears<br>
				(Now I'm cryin')<br>
				You leave the tears fallin' for years</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>And I say, baby, pretty little baby<br>
				Don't leave me<br>
				Baby, pretty little baby<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_6">Sweeter As The Days Go By</h2>
			<p>Oh you've got a smile like a sweet lovin' angel, oh baby<br>
				And you've got a heart that's made of pure gold, oh baby<br>
				You've given me so much that I'm grateful of such a faithful love<br>
				And it gets sweeter as the days go by, sweeter as the days go by</p>
			<p>Oh I'd be lost without you baby, now don't ever leave me<br>
				'Cause your sweet kiss turns on my sunshine, oh yeah baby<br>
				At night the stars, they wink at you, I-hi-hi have seen them, baby<br>
				Ah but I guess every single star knows how sweet you are<br>
				You get sweeter as the days go by, sweeter, honey, as the days go by</p>
			<p>(Backing vocals, over sax solo: Just a little sweeter, baby(x4)</p>
			<p>Now there are so many reasons for me to love you, oh baby<br>
				And I'm so lucky to have you and that's no lie, no baby<br>
				Yes, you're a candymaker's dream come true, and darlin', sugar has nothin' on you<br>
				And you get sweeter as the days go by, sweeter as the days go by<br>
				Honey, you're sweeter than honey, you're sweeter than sugar<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_7">Sweet Thing</h2>
			<p>Oh you don't always say the words I wanna hear, no baby<br>
				To me you're really saying something dear<br>
				Oh you're not the kind of girl to win a beauty prize<br>
				Just your smile, girl, lets me know where your beauty lies<br>
				Makes me realize you're a sweet thing, you're a sweet thing baby</p>
			<p>Listen honey, you can't seem to do the things I ask you to<br>
				Oh but I can't help but love the way you do the things you do<br>
				Oh you're not the kind of girl that men just can't resist<br>
				There's a certain something in your kiss, oh makes me wanna sing<br>
				Oh you're a sweet thing, you are a sweet thing baby</p>
			<p>Oh there may be a lot of things you'll never be<br>
				Ooo but the little things you are, they mean everything to me<br>
				So love, don't ever try and be all mankind's ideal<br>
				Just stay the way you are right now girl, truthful and for real<br>
				You've got your appeal<br>
				Oh you're a sweet thing, honey you're a sweet thing<br>
				You're sweeter than wine, that's why I'm glad you're mine<br>
				Baby, sweeter than a rose, ooo so my love just grows and grows<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_8">The World Is Rated X</h2>
			<p>Oh the world's situation should be rated X, oh rated X<br>
				Said the world's situation should be rated X, yeah rated X<br>
				Listen people, let only in the movie show<br>
				Take a look outside, I swear the truth is really told<br>
				It's life in living color; fighting, killing, drug-dealing, it's everywhere<br>
				What about the crime? Rated X<br>
				What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?<br>
				They let the children see life destroyed<br>
				But they won't let them see its making<br>
				What happened to God's creations?<br>
				The one thing that really bothers me the most<br>
				Is how we come, how we take the lives of the fold<br>
				The world today is in a grave situation<br>
				Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair</p>
			<p>Na na na... Oh I know something's missing all over the world<br>
				Ooo, rated X (several times over sax solo)<br>
				Oh I know something's missing all over the world</p>
			<p>The world's situation should be rated X, rated X<br>
				The world's situation should be rated X, rated X<br>
				What about the crime? Rated X<br>
				What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?<br>
				They let the children see life destroyed<br>
				But they won't let them see its making<br>
				What happened to God's creations?<br>
				Where're the wars, where's the peace?<br>
				Where's the joy, where's the woe for us all?<br>
				Love is kneelin', rated X<br>
				Hate is overweight, rated X<br>
				...and fade</p>
