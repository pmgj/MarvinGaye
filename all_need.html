			<h2 id="fx_1">Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing</h2>
			<div>(Nickolas Ashford/Valerie Simpson)</div>
			<p>Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>
			<p>I got your picture hangin' on the wall<br>
				It can't see or come to me when I call your name<br>
				I realize it's just a picture in a frame</p>
			<p>I read your letters when you're not near<br>
				But they don't move me<br>
				And they don't groove me like when I hear<br>
				Your sweet voice whispering in my ear</p>
			<p>Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>
			<p>I play the game, a fantasy<br>
				I pretend I'm not in reality<br>
				I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me</p>
			<p>No other sound is quite the same as your name<br>
				No touch can do half as much to make me feel better<br>
				So let's stay together</p>
			<p>I got some memories to look back on<br>
				And though they help me when you phone<br>
				I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there</p>
			<p>So let me get the real thing<br>
				So let me get the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby<br>
				Ain't nothing like the real thing</p>

			<h2 id="fx_2">You're All I Need To Get By</h2>
			<div>(Nickolas Ashford/Valerie Simpson)</div>
			<p>You're all I need to get by.<br>
				Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you,<br>
				And it was plain to see,<br>
				you were my destiny. With my arms open wide,<br>
				I threw away my pride<br>
				I'll sacrifice for you<br>
				Dedicate my life for you<br>
				I will go where you lead<br>
				Always there in time of need<br>
				And when I lose my will<br>
				You'll be there to push me up the hill<br>
				There's no, no looking back for us<br>
				We got love sure 'nough, that's enough<br>
				You're all, You're All I need to get by.<br>
				I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more<br>
				All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one<br>
				You're all, You're all I need to get by.</p>
			<p>You're all I need to get by.<br>
				Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best,<br>
				Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me<br>
				Darling in you I found<br>
				Strength where I was torn down<br>
				Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door<br>
				Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher<br>
				I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal<br>
				Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination<br>
				You're all, You're All I need to get by.<br>
				I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more<br>
				All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one<br>
				You're all, You're all I need to get by.</p>

				M: Oh Tammi<br>
				T: What good am I without you<br>
				M: I can't do without you, darlin'<br>
				BOTH: Like a sea wihout a shore<br>
				Kicking forever more</p>
			<p>M: Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind<br>
				T: Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind<br>

				'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe<br>
				If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe<br>
				Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me<br>
				'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately<br>
				Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me<br>
				...and fade</p>

				but before you go, think about my proposition<br>
				you may conquer the world and be king on a throne<br>
				but you still ain't nobody, baby<br>

			<div>(Harvey Fuqua/Johnny Bristol)</div>
			<p>You can try to win my love, but it's just too late<br>
				Try &amp; try again, but to lose me is your fate<br>
