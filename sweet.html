      <h1>How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You</h1>

      <h2 id="fx_1">You're A Wonderful One</h2>
      <div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
      <p>You are so wonderful<br>
        That being near you is all I'm living for<br>
        You show me more kindness in little ways<br>
        Than I've ever known in all my days<br>
        Tell me we'll stay together<br>
        Let me love you forever<br>
        'Cause you're a wonderful one<br>
        You're a wonderful one</p>
      <p>(From now on, backing vocals: &#8220;Wonderful one&#8221;)<br>
        In you there is a rare quality<br>
        Your love, baby, it means the world<br>
        For me you're always concerned<br>
        And you ask nothin', baby, in return<br>
        You're really more than I deserve<br>
        From my heart I mean these words<br>
        You're a wonderful one<br>
        You're a wonderful one</p>
      <p>Oh you're a wonderful one<br>
        Baby, you're a wonderful one<br>
        Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one<br>
        My darlin', you're a wonderful one<br>
        Ooo you're a wonderful one<br>
        Ooo you're a wonderful one<br>
        Mmm hmm you're a wonderful one<br>
        Baby, you're a wonderful one<br>
        You're really more than I deserve<br>
        From my heart I mean these words<br>
        You're a wonderful one<br>
        You're a wonderful one</p>
      <p>Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down<br>
        But your love, you're always around<br>
        Words of confidence you speak to me<br>
        Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek<br>
        It makes my burden a little bit lighter<br>
        It makes my life a little bit brighter<br>
        'Cause you're a wonderful one<br>
        You're a wonderful one</p>
      <p>(repeat and fade):<br>
        Oh you're a wonderful one<br>
        Baby, you're a wonderful one<br>
        etc.</p>

      <div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
      <p>How sweet it is to be loved by you<br>
        How sweet it is to be loved by you</p>
      <p>I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were<br>
        I needed someone to understand my ups and downs<br>
        and there you were<br>
        With sweet love and devotion<br>
        deeply touching my emotion<br>
        I want to stop and thank you baby<br>
        I just want to stop and thank you baby</p>
      <p>How sweet it is to be loved by you<br>
        How sweet it is to be loved by you</p>
      <p>I close my eyes at night,<br>
        wondering where would I be without you in my life<br>
        Everything I did was just a bore,<br>
        everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before<br>
        But you brightened up for me all of my days<br>
        With a love so sweet in so many ways<br>
        I want to stop and thank you baby<br>
        I want to stop and thank you baby</p>
      <p>How sweet it is to be loved by you<br>
        How sweet it is to be loved by you</p>
      <p>You were better to me than I've been to myself<br>
        For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else<br>
        I want to stop and thank you baby<br>
        I just want to stop and thank you baby</p>
      <p>(repeat and fade):<br>
        How sweet it is to be loved by you<br>
        How sweet it is to be loved by you</p>

      <h2 id="fx_3">Try It Baby</h2>
      <div>(Berry Gordy)</div>
      <p>Now you're moving on up, pretty baby<br>
        You're leaving me behind<br>
        Everybody seems to love you<br>
        Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine</p>
      <p>But take away your good looks<br>
        And all your fancy clothes<br>
        Why don't you just<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby</p>
      <p>You'll see<br>
        Nobody loves you but me</p>
      <p>Now you tell me that you so busy, pretty baby<br>
        You ain't got much time<br>
        Oh, how will I remember<br>
        When all your time was mine, mine, mine</p>
      <p>Well move on back cross the track, baby<br>
        Where you came from<br>
        Why don't you just <br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it baby</p>
      <p>You'll see<br>
        That nobody loves you but me<br>
        Nobody loves you but me</p>
      <p>I really want to hold you, pretty baby<br>
        In my arms again<br>
        But I can't get close to you<br>
        For all your loving friend, friend, friend<br>
        But take your name from the bright lights baby<br>
        And tell me that you are all through<br>
        Come on and <br>
        Try it honey<br>
        Try it baby<br>
        Try it sweetheart<br>
        Try it honey<br>
        You'll see, nobody loves you but me</p>

      <h2 id="fx_4">Baby Don't You Do It</h2>
      <div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
      <p>Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe<br>
        Don't break my heart, don't do it babe<br>
        Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe<br>
        Don't you break my heart<br>
        'Cause I sacrifice to make you happy<br>
        Get nothin' for myself<br>
        Now you wanna leave me<br>
        For the love of someone else<br>
        My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong<br>
        I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keepin' on<br>
        Girl, I try to do my best<br>
        Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe<br>
        Don't break my heart, oh don't do it baby<br>
        Don't break my heart</p>
      <p>My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much<br>
        And lettin' you know<br>
        'Cause now you've got me where you want me<br>
        And you're gonna let me go<br>
        My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see<br>
        Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me<br>
        Girl, I try to do my best<br>
        Girl, I try to do my best<br>
        Don't you do it, don't break my heart</p>
      <p>Go down to the river and there I'll be<br>
        I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me<br>
        Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?<br>
        Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?<br>
        I'm no good without you, can't go on without you<br>
        Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?<br>
        Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart<br>
        Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart<br>
        What'm I gonna do without you?<br>
        Got to go on, baby<br>
        Baby don't you do it<br>

      <p>Darlin', forever, forever<br>
        You can break my heart<br>
        Forever, if you want to<br>
        I'll play the part of a fool<br>
        Just to be with you forever</p>
      <p>Forever, darling, forever<br>
        You can taunt me<br>
        Take my love for granted<br>
        But I'll always be just a fool<br>
        Just to be with you forever</p>
      <p>I'll be your slave<br>
        For the rest of my days<br>
        Love you more in so many ways<br>
        Just to be with you thrills me through and through</p>
      <p>And darlin', forever, forever<br>
        You can taunt me<br>
        Take my love for granted<br>
        But I'll always be just a fool<br>
        Just to be with you forever</p>
      <p>Forever, forever, I'll love you so<br>
