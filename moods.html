			<h2 id="fx_1">I'll Be Doggone</h2>
			<div>(William &#8220;Smokey&#8221; Robinson/Warren Moore/Marvin Tarplin)</div>
			<p>Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day<br>
				And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay<br>
				But if I ever caught you running around<br>
				Blowing my money all over this town</p>
			<p>Then I wouldn't be doggone<br>
				Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone<br>
				Then I wouldn't be doggone<br>
				I'd be long gone</p>
			<p>Now hey, hey, hey!<br>
				I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing<br>
				And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring<br>
				And if we live to be a hundred years old<br>
				If you ever let that spring turn cold</p>
			<p>Then I wouldn't be doggone<br>
				Hey! I'd be long gone<br>
				Oh I wouldn't be doggone<br>
				I'd be long gone</p>
			<p>Now did you hear what I say ?<br>
				Well now what I say<br>
				Oh, believe me Well, every woman should try<br>
				To be what ever has man wants her to be<br>
				And I don't want much<br>
				All I want from you is for you to be true to me</p>
			<p>Well, I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend<br>
				Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end<br>
				Though I know you make me feel like no baby could<br>
				If I ever found out that you're no good</p>
			<p>Then I wouldn't be doggone<br>
				Hey, hey, hey, I'd be long gone<br>
				Well I wouldn't de doggone baby<br>
				I'd be long gone</p>

			<h2 id="fx_2">Little Darling (I Need You)</h2>
			<div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
			<p>It's so hard lovin' you<br>
				But I don't wanna let you go<br>
				Little darlin' I need you (Little darlin' I need you)<br>
				Little darlin' I love you (Little darlin' I love you)<br>
				Little darlin' I want you (Little darlin' I want you)<br>
				Little darlin' I've got to have you (Little darlin' I've got to have you)<br>
				And if it means giving up my life<br>
				I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up<br>
				There's always one who loves more than the other<br>
				But I don't mind, I don't mind<br>
				I'm willing to pay the price<br>
				Have your love at any sacrifice</p>
			<p>Little darlin' I need you...</p>
			<p>I know there's two or three in your life<br>
				You like as well as me<br>
				So if I have to be your #1 fool<br>
				Before you care, care about me<br>
				Then I'm willing to pay the price<br>
				Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice<br>
				Oh baby</p>
			<p>Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby<br>
				Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby<br>
				My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only<br>
				Now I'm willing to pay the price<br>
				Be your #1 at any sacrifice</p>
			<p>Little darlin' I need you...<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_3">Take This Heart Of Mine</h2>
			<div>(Smokey Robinson/Pete Moore/Marv Tarplin)</div>
			<p>Ooo, you say you're feelin' bad 'cause<br>
				The least thing makes you cry<br>
				Sounds like a real bad case<br>
				Of a girl who needs a guy<br>
				I think I know the perfect jewel<br>
				One you ought to try<br>
				Take a heart that's full of love<br>
				On this you can rely</p>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine<br>
				And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine<br>
				And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine<br>
				I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine</p>
			<p>I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills<br>
				Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills<br>
				My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill<br>
				My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)<br>
				That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)<br>
				Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)<br>
				To have and to hold (this heart of mine)<br>
				And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)<br>
				After we grow old (this heart of mine)<br>
				It'll be the greatest love story (this heart of mine)<br>
				That was ever told (this heart of mine)<br>
				Oh, baby (one more time, let's hold)</p>
			<p>Oh, medicine won't cure you<br>
				Just leave you at the most<br>
				The relief is only temporary<br>
				Pretty soon will go<br>
				But love can last a lifetime<br>
				When two hearts are close<br>
				Take as much as you want to<br>
				There is no overdose</p>
			<p>(repeat chorus and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_5">One More Heartache</h2>
			<div>(Smokey Robinson/Ronnie White/Pete Moore/Bobby Rogers/Marv Tarplin)</div>
			<p>One more heartache, I can't take it<br>
				My heart is carryin' such a heavy load<br>
				One more ache would break it<br>
				Just like the camel with the heavy back<br>
				One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back</p>
			<p>Ah (ah) ah (ah)<br>
				I can't take it, I can't stand it</p>
			<p>One more heartache, it would turn me right around<br>
				First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down<br>
				Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table<br>
				One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able</p>
			<p>Ah (ah) ah (ah)<br>
				I can't take it, I can't stand it<br>
				No no no baby</p>
			<p>Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load<br>
				I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode<br>
				Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take<br>
				One more puff of air and that balloon has got to burst</p>
			<p>Ah (ah) ah (ah)<br>
				I can't take it, I can't stand it<br>
				No, honey, not another<br>
				...and fade</p>

			<h2 id="fx_6">Ain't That Peculiar</h2>
			<div>(William &#8220;Smokey&#8221; Robinson/Marvin Tarplin/Robert Rogers/Warren Moore)</div>
			<p>Honey you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you<br>
				Stay away too long and i can't do without you<br>
				Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more<br>
				But each hurt makes my love stronger than before<br>
				I know flowers go through rain <br>
				But how can love go through pain</p>
			<p>Ain't that peculiar<br>
				A peculiar ality<br>
				Ain't that peculiar baby<br>
				Peculiar as can be</p>
			<p>You tell me lies that should be obvious to me<br>
				I've been so much in love with you baby til i don't wanna see<br>
				That things you do and say are designed to make me blue<br>
				It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all<br>
				Your lies seem true<br>
				But if the truth makes love last longer<br>
				Why do lies make my love stronger</p>
			<p>Ain't that peculiar<br>
				A peculiar ality<br>
				Ain't that peculiar baby<br>
				Peculiar as can be</p>
			<p>I cried so much just like a child thats lost its home<br>
				Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy<br>
				A child can cry so much until you do everything they say<br>
				But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way<br>
				I know love can last through years<br>
				But how can love last through tears</p>
			<p>(repeat chorus)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_9">Your Unchanging Love</h2>
			<div>(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)</div>
			<p>CHORUS:<br>
				I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)<br>
				To your unchanging love<br>
				I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)<br>
				To your unchanging love<br>
				I need you baby, baby I need you right now</p>
			<p>Darlin', there comes a time in everybody's life<br>
				They may learn as I've learned<br>
				That being loved is more important than paintin' the town<br>
				Only noon and night<br>
				'Cause my life may have bright lights<br>
				But I've learned in time they go dim<br>
				But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>I used to have more friends than I could count<br>
				But now all of my so-called friends are gone<br>
				'Cause I've lost everything in my bank account<br>
				Darlin', I'm tired of runnin' 'round<br>
				So in your arms I'm gonna settle down<br>
				'Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine</p>
			<p>(chorus)</p>
			<p>Darlin', everybody need somebody, ooo I need you<br>
				I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do<br>
				One more thing:<br>
				I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits<br>
				Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you<br>
				That's why...</p>
			<p>(repeat chorus and fade)</p>

			<h2 id="fx_12">One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)</h2>
			<div>(Johnny Mercer/Harold Arlen)</div>
			<p>It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place<br>
				Except you and me<br>
				So set 'em' up Joe, I got a little story<br>
				I think you should know<br>
				We're drinking my friend, to the end<br>
				Of a brief episode<br>
				Make it one for my baby<br>
				And one more for the road<br>
				I know the routine, put another nickel<br>
				In the machine<br>
				I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music<br>
				Easy and sad<br>
				I could tell you a lot, but it's not<br>
				In a gentleman's code<br>
				Make it one for my baby<br>
				And one more for the road<br>
				You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet<br>
				And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say<br>
				And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me<br>
				Till it's talked away<br>
				Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin'<br>
				Anxious to close<br>
				Thanks for the cheer<br>
				I hope you didn't mind<br>
				My bending your ear<br>
				But this torch that I found, It's gotta be drowned<br>
				Or it's gonna explode<br>
				Make it one for my baby<br>
				And one more for the road</p>
