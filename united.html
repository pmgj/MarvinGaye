      <div>(Harvey Fuqua/Johnny Bristol/Vernon Bullock)</div>
      <p>M:
         If I could build my whole world around you, darlin'<br>
         First I'd put heaven by your side<br>
         Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey<br>
         And over your head would be the bluest sky<br>
         And I'd take every drop of rain<br>
         And wash all your troubles away<br>
         I'd have the whole world built around you<br>
         And that would be all right, oh yes it would</p>
      <p>T:
         If I could build my whole world around you<br>
         I'd make your eyes the morning sun<br>
         I'd put so much love where there is sorrow<br>
         I'd put joy where there's never been love<br>
         And I'd give my love to you<br>
         To keep for the rest of your life<br>
         And happiness would surely be ours<br>
         And that would be all right, oh yes it would</p>
      <p>BOTH: Doo doo doo doo...</p>
      <p>M: Oh, if I could build my whole world around you<br>
         I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess<br>
         T: And I'd step into this world you've created<br>
         And give you true love and tenderness<br>
         And there'd be something new with every tomorrow<br>
         To make this world better as days go by</p>

      <h2 id="fx_4">Something Stupid</h2>
      <div>(C. Carson Parks)</div>
      <p>I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me.<br>
         And if we go some place to dance I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me.<br>
         Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two.<br>
         And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
      <p>I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before.<br>
         And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true and never felt so right before.</p>
      <p>I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true,<br>
         But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.<br>
         The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh the night so blue.<br>
         And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh the night so blue.<br>
         And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like &#8220;I love you.&#8221;<br>
         And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
      <p>"I love you."<br>
         "I love you."<br>
         "I love you."</p>

      <div>(Nickolas Ashford/Valerie Simpson)</div>
      <p>MARVIN:<br>
         Every day there's something new<br>
         Honey, to keep me lovin' you<br>
         And with every passin' minute<br>
         Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it</p>
      <p>CHORUS:<br>
         TAMMI: Heaven must have sent you from above<br>
         BOTH: Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love</p>
      <p>T:<br>
         And I, I've got a song to sing<br>
         Tellin' the world about the joy you bring<br>
         And you gave me a reason for livin'<br>
         And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'</p>
      <p>(chorus)</p>
      <p>M: To find a love like ours is rare these days<br>
         'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways<br>
         T: I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see<br>
         Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be</p>
      <p>M: What you've given me I could never return<br>
         'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn<br>
         T: And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation<br>
         'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration</p>
